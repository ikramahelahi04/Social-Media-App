# Social Media App Clone

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **social media app clone** developed using **Python, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), and QtDesigner**. It was created as the final project for the **CS/CE 355: Database Management Systems** course.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **QtDesigner** – Designed the graphical user interface (GUI), including login, main feed, profile pages, and more.  
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** – Managed the database with tables for users, followers, photos, likes, and comments.  
- **Python** – Connected the GUI to the database and handled user interactions via SQL queries.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **User Authentication** – Sign up and log in functionality.  
- **Profile Management** – View and edit user profiles.  
- **Search Users** – Find and follow other users.  
- **Image Uploads** – Users can upload images.  
- **Engagement** – Like and comment on posts.  
- **Admin Portal** – Admins can log in and delete user accounts.  

## 🔗 How It Works  
- The GUI, built with QtDesigner, connects to the **database** via the Python script **start.py**.  
- User credentials are verified against the **User table** in SSMS.  
- **SQL queries** in Python retrieve and update database records based on user interactions.  
- Data such as usernames, profile images, likes, and comments are dynamically fetched from the database and displayed in the GUI.
